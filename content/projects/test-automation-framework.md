Evolved a test automation framework from a CLI utility into a containerized, Kubernetes-backed system. Supported concurrent test runs, generated structured audit logs, and integrated with Jira XRAY. Reduced validation time from days to hours, improved efficiency by 80%, and was adopted as a standard across multiple teams.
