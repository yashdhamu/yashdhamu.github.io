An event-driven banking system built in Python with gRPC and Protobuf. The system maintains strong client-centric consistency across multiple branches using distributed locking, event ordering, and logical clocks. Fault tolerance ensures data integrity and 99.9%+ consistency, even under concurrent operations and node failures.
